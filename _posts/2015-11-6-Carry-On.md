Well I woke up to the sound of silence

The cars were cutting like knives in a fist fight

And I found you with a bottle of wine

Your head in the curtains

and heart like the fourth of July

You swore and said, we are not

We are not shining stars

This I know, I never said we are

Though I've never been through hell like that

I've closed enough windows

to know you can never look back

If you're lost and alone

Or you're sinking like a stone

Carry on

May your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground

Carry on

Carry on, carry on

So I met up with some friends at the edge of the night

At a bar off 75

And we talked and talked about how our parents will die

All our neighbors and wives

But I'd like to think I can cheat it all

To make up for the times I've been cheated on

And it's nice to know when I was left for dead

I was found and now I don't roam these streets

I am not the ghost you want of me

If you're lost and alone

Or you're sinking like a stone

Carry on

May your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground

Carry on

Woah

My head is on fire but my legs are fine

After all they are mine

Lay your clothes down on the floor

Close the door, hold the phone, show me how

No one's ever gonna stop us now

Cause we are

We are shining stars

We are invincible

We are who we are

On our darkest day

When we're miles away

Sun will come

We will find our way home

If you're lost and alone

Or you're sinking like a stone

Carry on

May your past be the sound

Of your feet upon the ground

Carry on
